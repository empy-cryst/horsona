# Horsona: The Swiss Army Knife of Pony Chatbot Creation
Creating a realistic pony chatbot is very difficult. This repo will try to maintain
an organized collection of features that a pony chatbot might need in the hopes that
future chatbot developers will have a easier time with it.

I don't know yet what functionality will be in here or how it will be organized.
Here's a candidate list:
- Video generation (via API) alongside text generation
- Plugins for various interfaces (SillyTavern, Risu, etc.)
- Automated character card adjustments
- Lorebook generation from large text corpora
- Splitting prompts into multiple calls for more reliable generation
- Simultaneously accounting for multiple kinds of data
- In-universe and retrospective consistency checks
- Organizing text corpora into compatible universes
- Support for RPG functionality, like HP, XP, and dice rolls based on a rule book
